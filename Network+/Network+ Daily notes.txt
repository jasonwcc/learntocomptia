LAN (Local Area Network)
- Infrastructure team
- Point-to-Point topology
  : PC/Server to SWITCH
  : Router to Router
  : Switch to Switch
- Star topology
  : middle use hub/switch/bridge
vs
WAN (Wide Area Network)
- subscribe to Service Provider(SP)
- monthly/yearly bill
- Point-to-Point topology
  : Frame-Relay
  : ATM
  : PPP
- Hub and Spoke topology
  : Routers
  : connect branch offices to HQ
- Partial MESH topology
  : some branches connect to HQ
- Full MESH topology
  : every branch connect to every branch
    as well as to HQ

802.11AC = WIFI 5

ARP 
- address resolution protocol
- resolve IP into MAC

Data Link (L2)
- MAC address (physical address)
- unique globally, never change
- 48 bits
- engine chassis number

Network (L3)
- IP address (logical address)
- unique over LAN/subnet
- can keep changing
- car number plate

Bridge
- stop R&D
- 4/8/12
vs
Switch
- L2 network appliance/device
- can understand/capture MAC
- do not care about IP
- Configure IP as remote management 
- Managed (cisco, hwa wei, juniper, zte, aruba, arista networkvs )
Unmanaged(TP-Link) 
- Ethernet / STAR topology
- uses CSMA/CD (zero chances collision)
vs
Hub
- L1 network appliance/device
- dummy network appliance
- do not understand anything(MAC/IP)
- usually is half duplex/10Mb
- share bandwidth
- Ethernet / STAR topology
- uses CSMA/CD (execute backoff algorithm when there is collision)
 : 2^n


vs
Bridge



Router
- routing (VPN, hybrid, interconnect on-prem to cloud)
- network address translation / NAT-ting
  --> translating private IP to public IP

Standard Ethernet frame MTU : 1500 bytes
Jumbo Ethernet frame MTU : 9000 bytes

Octal - Base 8

Hexadecimal - Base 16
- 0 to 9, a to f

VPN
- virtual private network
- connecting two private network via public(internet) network
- 15GB/s

Hybrid 
- VPN/private connection use Fibre optics
- 100/200 GB/s
- MY must go thru TIME

Single mode fibre
- long far
- single application
- interconnect two DC / site
Multi mode fibre
- multiple application
- short distance
- case use: within  DC

- PC to PC

Cisco Discovery Protocol 
(CDP)

Link Layer Discovery Protocol
(LLDP)

Switch has MAC address table
1. Learn MAC address received from PC/Server/Router and
   map to port number
2. Flood out to all ports except original port 
3. Filter and forward direct to known destination
